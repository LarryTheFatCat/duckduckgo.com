# duckduckgo recreation

I'm just using this to learn more about creating websites with front end development.

This is only supported with 1920x1080 resolution, I don't care about creating external desktop support
/
mobile support just yet I just started learning html and css 3 months ago I still have a lot to learn but hopefully
the future I'll be able to create a mobile friendly and external desktop friendly websites for you guys!

Things I took from the site:

Background-color
I had to do this because I'm terrible with colours and I don't want to bother spending 10 minutes getting an accurate result from it.
It was fast and easy enough the background-colour property they already used

Pull Requests,

If you ever do end up making a Pull Request on this GitHub profile, I only ask for 1 thing which is for mobile and external desktop support, if you, ever create this please explain how you did it, how it works, and what you can do with it in the near future as well as with other projects I can create with.

Questions:

If you ever have any questions please make a GitHub issue on this repository, and I'll try my best to respond to you as fast as I can, I'm not a robot so I do have a life but be patient. If you want a quicker response you can reach out to my Discord account which is Two#6969, I'm active on discord a lot as I am a support moderator to help people with their issues on multiple popular servers. I do have a quick response time and is probably active everyday 7 days a week for now (It's Summer Vacation), creating these projects are very fun because I learn new things everytime I recreate a website as well as learn new techniques and inqueries about coding in a Markup language.
